As the description has mentioned, this is just a repot where I put all work for the 
"World of Zuul", a kind of Java Tutorial

**Dependencies**
A working version of Java is needed </br>
For myself, I'm using the jdk11 version </br>
also, the project can be opened by Bluej, however this is not an obligation </br>
