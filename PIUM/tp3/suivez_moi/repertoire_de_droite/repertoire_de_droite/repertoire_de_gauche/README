Introduction
============

This is GNU Bash, version 4.4.  Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne
Again SHell, a complete implementation of the POSIX shell spec,
but also with interactive command line editing, job control on
architectures that support it, csh-like features such as history
substitution and brace expansion, and a slew of other features. 
For more information on the features of Bash that are new to this
type of shell, see the file `doc/bashref.texi'.  There is also a
large Unix-style man page.  The man page is the definitive description
of the shell's features. 

See the file POSIX for a discussion of how the Bash defaults differ
from the POSIX spec and a description of the Bash `posix mode'.

=============== INDICATIONS ====================

Voici la clé pour trouver le trésor : vous devez trouver un répertoire
qui se nomme Le_tresor_est_ici. Dans ce répertoire vous trouverez
plein de fichiers avec des extensions différentes. Combien il y en
a-t-il ? Des milliers. Il faudra s'atteler pour les ranger. Créez des
répertoires pour chaque extension. Ensuite rangez les fichiers par
extension dans les répertoires correspondants. Le seul fichier sans
extension contient probablement le trésor.

note : l'extension d'un fichier est le groupe de 3 ou 4 lettres
précédé d'un point situé à la fin du nom d'un fichier.

============= FIN DES INDICATIONS ==============

There are some user-visible incompatibilities between this version
of Bash and previous widely-distributed versions, bash-4.2 and
bash-4.3.  For details, see the file COMPAT.  The NEWS file tersely
lists features that are new in this release. 

Bash is free software, distributed under the terms of the [GNU] General
Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,
version 3 of the License (or any later version).  For more information,
see the file COPYING. 

A number of frequently-asked questions are answered in the file
`doc/FAQ'.

To compile Bash, type `./configure', then `make'.  Bash auto-configures
the build process, so no further intervention should be necessary.  Bash
builds with `gcc' by default if it is available.  If you want to use `cc'
instead, type

	CC=cc ./configure

if you are using a Bourne-style shell.  If you are not, the following
may work:

	env CC=cc ./configure

Read the file INSTALL in this directory for more information about how
to customize and control the build process.  The file NOTES contains
platform-specific installation and configuration information.

If you are a csh user and wish to convert your csh aliases to Bash
aliases, you may wish to use the script `examples/misc/alias-conv.sh'
as a starting point.  The script `examples/misc/cshtobash' is a
more ambitious script that attempts to do a more complete job.

Reporting Bugs
==============

Bug reports for bash should be sent to:

	bug-bash@gnu.org

using the `bashbug' program that is built and installed at the same
time as bash.

The discussion list `bug-bash@gnu.org' often contains information
about new ports of Bash, or discussions of new features or behavior
changes that people would like.  This mailing list is also available
as a usenet newsgroup: gnu.bash.bug. 

When you send a bug report, please use the `bashbug' program that is
built at the same time as bash.  If bash fails to build, try building
bashbug directly with `make bashbug'.  If you cannot build `bashbug',
please send mail to bug-bash@gnu.org with the following information:

	* the version number and release status of Bash (e.g., 2.05a-release)
	* the machine and OS that it is running on (you may run
	  `bashversion -l' from the bash build directory for this information)
	* a list of the compilation flags or the contents of `config.h', if
	  appropriate
	* a description of the bug
	* a recipe for recreating the bug reliably
	* a fix for the bug if you have one!

The `bashbug' program includes much of this automatically.

Questions and requests for help with bash and bash programming may be
sent to the help-bash@gnu.org mailing list.

If you would like to contact the Bash maintainers directly, send mail
to bash-maintainers@gnu.org.

While the Bash maintainers do not promise to fix all bugs, we would
like this shell to be the best that we can make it.

Enjoy!
